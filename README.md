# Space-Invaders-Game-In-Pygame

This is a simple game built using the pygame module of python. I followed a Youtube tutorial and made this game.

This game has: 

a background image
player spaceship that can be controlled using the arrow keys
some enemyspacehips moving downwards
background music
shoot, gameover and explosion sound effect

I added extra randomness by including multiple background images, bg music, spaceships and used the random module. I have uploaded the few images 
here but not all of them because it was taking too much time to upload the sound effects and lots of images.
